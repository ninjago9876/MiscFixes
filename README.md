A simple mod that fixes some of the most annoying and gamebreaking bugs in some create related mods.

## Current Fixes:

- Blocks in copycats on VS2 ships when assembled or disassembled no longer drop (while staying in the copycat block)

## TODO:

- With Create: Interactive, contraptions with mechanical drills or harvesters don't output to inventories unless an "Interact Me" block is present
